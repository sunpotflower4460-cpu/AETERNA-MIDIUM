/**
 * nowSummary.ts
 * U5: Overview / Now Summary / Event Timeline
 *
 * Defines the NowSummaryLine and NowSummaryState types used to present
 * a short, factual 3–5 line summary of what is currently happening in
 * AETERNA's torus field.
 *
 * Principles:
 * - Text lines describe observable field conditions in neutral terms.
 * - Forbidden expressions: "thinking", "wants", "feels", "lonely", "conscious",
 *   "understands", "remembered you", "became aware", or any emotion claim.
 * - Rule-based / local derivation only — no LLM, no API key required.
 * - 3–5 lines maximum; priority-ranked lines are selected for display.
 * - valueKind labels are required so readers know the epistemic status.
